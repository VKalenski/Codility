# C# Codility Solutions
-----------------

My C# solutions to the Codility tasks at https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/

Almost all of the tasks were straightforward and the available time was more than enough, but few took me more than the 120min to reach 100% ._.

These are my own implementations. As I enjoy small and concise codes, whatever doesn't fit in this rule means that I had problems. Until now, there's one code in this category :)

<table>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3"><h3>Lesson 1 - Iterations</h3></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>BinaryGap</td>
        <td><a href="01_Iterations/BinaryGap.md">Problem Statement</a></td>
        <td><a href="01_Iterations/BinaryGap.cs">Solution</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan="3"><h3>Lesson 2 - Arrays</h3></td>
    </tr>
</table>
